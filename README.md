# Team project: Build a product page

This sprint, your team is tasked with creating the home page for [Google Business](https://www.google.com/intl/en/services/#?modal_active=none). If we look closely at the page, you'll notice it contains all the parts a standard website nowadays includes â€” A header with navigation, a "Hero" section, modules running down the page with images and text, and finally a footer. So after this sprint youâ€™ll be able to build about the majority of all web pages out there. Or, at least the front-end parts ðŸ˜ƒ

At the end of this sprint youâ€™ll be showing off your brand new sites to Google themselves!

## How to complete this project

You'll find an index.html and style.css file in the code folder of this repository to get started with.

### Teamwork

We have invited Charlotte Andersson as a guest lecturer in agile and scrum. She will give you tools in how you best divide your work and work together in your teams. One of the challenges in this project is to learn how to work as a team. As a web developer this is something you do on a daily basis.

We suggest trying "mob programming". Mob programming is where one person is in control of a computer and is in charge of writing code, and the rest of the team is the mind - they tell the person typing what to type. As a team, you work towards a common goal. Then, every 15-20 minutes, you change who's in control of the computer (or switch computers).

### The page

Components your one-pager should have:

#### Responsive header
The menu should work on all screen sizes. It should have a logotype, navigational links and one dropdown.

#### Hero background image
A large cover image in the hero section.

#### Three selling points
Responsive grid with three selling points containing icons and copy for each of them.

#### Feature section
List your top features with an image, text and button for each of them.

#### Footer
A navigational footer with social media links.

### Git & GitHub

Working as a team on GitHub takes some getting used to. If two members of your team edit code in the same file in the project and push the code to GitHub, there's a fair chance you'll run into a situation where your code conflicts. You'll have to solve the conflicts as a team and think of your team mates when committing code. **Committing small changes, very regularly makes it MUCH easier to handle conflicts**. Really - commit early and often.

When you do encounter a conflict, don't panic! Follow the [steps here](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/a75f1f725d33a1834dd7f5feebbc7d4b) to resolve the conflict and then commit the fixed code.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this project, you should be comfortable with working as a team in a web project, know how to build a responsive webpage from scratch, build modules you can typical find on any webpage, like responsive menu, grid sections, hero images and footer.

### :mortar_board: Demo

As a team, be prepared to answer the following questions:

1. Show what you have built!
2. How did you structure your work?
3. What are you most proud of?
4. What did you struggle with?
